As we zoomed into our local neighborhoods, we decided on three major factors that would rank our neighborhood agaisnt the rest in the borough. Focusing on outdoor dining specifically, we determined that **Transit Access**,**Greenery/Shade**,**Safety** were the three most apparent and relevant criteria for the anylysis. As NYC is a very urban environment with a big transit system and not everyone owns a car, it was important that people had multiple ways of accessing the food scene in the area. Safety was probably the most important factor as many dining establishments run late into the night and that is when the city is most alive. It was important to assess how safe it would be to dine out late into the night. Greenery and Shade was our way of looking at how the overall atmosphere and environment of the neighborhood fit the idea of dining out. Although not statistical, we looked at reviews on whether or not people enjoyed their time dining in that neighborhood.
