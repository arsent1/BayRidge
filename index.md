This is a map of Bay Ridge. It is located next to the Verrazano Bridge and adjacent to the Hudson River and Belt Parkway. It's a very
family friendly neighborhood due to its low crime rate, plentiful amount of public parks, and public
schools. Over the years, the demographics of the neighborhood changed signficantly as in earlier years it was predominantly white, specifically
Italian, but over the years many Asian and Hispanic immigrants settled in the area which created a more diverse population.
